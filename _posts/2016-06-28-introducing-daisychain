[Daisychain](https://www.daisychain.me) connects web services to make your life easier.

Daisychain is an open-source alternative for IFTTT. It is not only easy to use, but also easy to extend, easy to configure, and easy to be hosted on your own server.
That way you do not have to trust some third-party closed-source service. You always own your data. You will never have to guess what is going on under the hood.
